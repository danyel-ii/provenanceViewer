# Canon: provenance as trace

Provenance is treated as trace: evidence of how a cube was composed, cited, and held.
We surface traces, not verdicts. Every claim must link to evidence.

## Core statements
- Trace is compositional: references, citations, and metadata that shaped the cube.
- Trace is custodial: mint and ownership signals that show custody, not intent.
- Trace is auditable: sources remain visible so others can rehydrate or verify.
- Trace is bounded: unknowns stay unknown; confidence and limitations are explicit.
- Trace is read-only: this viewer never mints, signs, or writes on-chain.

## Practical implications
- Prefer citations over narration; use metadata and transaction evidence.
- Distinguish "compositional provenance" from "custody provenance".
- Never claim certainty when evidence is partial.
